# Awesome-PhD [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of carefully selected tools and resources I wish I knew when starting my PhD. All of these tools make your life SO MUCH easier and are both for early career as well as more senior researchers (or even if you are not in academia, for that matter). The original Twitter thread where I started this list can be found [here](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann/status/1473735195920633859).

This repository is intended to be a living, constantly developing resource where everybody can contribute new resources! If you want to contribute, please read the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/helenahartmann/awesome-PhD/blob/main/contributing_guidelines.md) first, then send a pull request or contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann) in case of any questions.

It stresses the primary importance of adding value, rather than only providing an overview, and it then discusses some of the reasons for (or not) actually writing an LRP, including issues relating to the nature and scope of the paper. It also presents different types of LRPs, advises on reporting the methodology used for the selection of papers for review, and the structure of an LRP. An important conclusion is that the heterogeneity in LRPs is very large. This paper also presents some of the aspects that the authors feel are important structural and contextual considerations that help produce high-quality review papers.
